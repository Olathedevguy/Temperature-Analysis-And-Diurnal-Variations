## Introduction

Dynamic Temperature Range (DTR) is an important metric in environmental studies. It helps researchers understand temperature fluctuations over time. This repository focuses on providing tools to analyze DTR data effectively. 

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Olathedevguy/Temperature-Analysis-And-Diurnal-Variations/releases).

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare your dataset for analysis by removing inconsistencies.
- **Case-Control Matching**: Match case and control groups for accurate comparisons.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform paired t-tests to evaluate temperature variations.
- **Visualizations**: Generate graphs to visualize temperature trends.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples for easy usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Olathedevguy/Temperature-Analysis-And-Diurnal-Variations.git
   cd Temperature-Analysis-And-Diurnal-Variations
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Data**:
   Download your DTR dataset and place it in the `data` folder.

## Usage

Once you have set up the repository, you can start using the scripts. The main script is `analyze_temperature.py`. You can run it as follows:

```bash
python analyze_temperature.py --input data/your_dataset.csv --output results/output.csv
```

Replace `your_dataset.csv` with the name of your dataset.

## Data Processing

Data processing is crucial for accurate analysis. The scripts in this repository help you clean and prepare your data. 

### Steps for Data Cleaning

1. **Load Data**: Use pandas to load your dataset.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Decide how to treat missing data points.
3. **Remove Outliers**: Identify and remove any outliers that could skew results.

Here is a sample code snippet for loading and cleaning data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')

# Handle missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Remove outliers
data = data[data['temperature'] < threshold]
```

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis helps in understanding the significance of your findings. This repository includes scripts for performing paired t-tests.

### Performing a Paired T-Test

Use the following code to perform a paired t-test:

```python
from scipy import stats

# Assume 'group1' and 'group2' are two lists of temperature data
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(group1, group2)

print(f'T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}')
```

A low p-value indicates a significant difference between the two groups.

## Visualizations

Visualizing data can help communicate findings effectively. Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create graphs.

### Example Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(data['date'], data['temperature'])
plt.title('Temperature Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (¬∞C)')
plt.show()
```
